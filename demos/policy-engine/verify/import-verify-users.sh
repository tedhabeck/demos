# Provision the demo personas into an IBM Verify tenant from verify/users.csv.
#
# This closes the gap left by decision D5 in
# docs/brainstorms/2026-08-31-ibm-verify-idp-requirements.md ("tenant setup is
# documented, not automated") for the part that is most tedious and most
# error-prone by hand: the four users, their four custom attributes, and the
# manager relationships between them.
#
# Usage:
#   ./import-verify-users.sh                    # create attrs + users
#   ./import-verify-users.sh --dry-run          # print the SCIM payloads, send nothing
#   ./import-verify-users.sh --attrs-only       # define the custom attributes, no users
#   ./import-verify-users.sh --users-only       # assume attributes already exist
#   ./import-verify-users.sh --csv other.csv    # a different user source
#   ./import-verify-users.sh --delete           # remove the CSV's users from the tenant
#
# Requires: curl, jq, python3 (CSV parsing only — no third-party packages).
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# What this needs from the tenant, and why it is a SEPARATE client
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The Users and Attributes APIs authenticate with a Verify *API client* whose
# entitlements are checked per-endpoint — these are entitlements, not OAuth
# scopes:
#
#   manageUsers       (or manageUserGroups)  -> POST/DELETE /v2.0/Users
#   manageAttributes                         -> POST /v1.0/attributes
#
# Neither hr-copilot (HR_COPILOT_CLIENT_ID) nor the gateway exchange client
# (GATEWAY_CLIENT_ID) has them, and they should not: those two are in the demo's
# hot path, and a client that can mint alice's token should not also be able to
# rewrite alice's permissions. Create a third API client in
#   Security -> API access -> Add API client
# and put its credentials in .env.verify (gitignored) as:
#
#   VERIFY_ADMIN_CLIENT_ID=...
#   VERIFY_ADMIN_CLIENT_SECRET=...
#
# The tenant URL is derived from IBM_VERIFY_TOKEN_ENDPOINT in
# post_deploy_variables.json, so there is nothing else to configure.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The empty-string padding is GONE — the engine handles scalars now
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Verify still serialises a custom attribute holding exactly one value as a JSON
# SCALAR, not a one-element array. This used to be load-bearing here: Praxis's
# standard claim mapper read roles/teams/permissions via Value::as_array, which
# returns None for a JSON string, so a single-role persona got an EMPTY
# subject.roles with no error raised, `require(role.hr)` failed, and the whole
# thing presented as a policy deny rather than the config fault it was. Every
# multi-valued attribute was therefore padded with a trailing "" to force array
# shape, at the known cost that "" became a real set member and showed up in
# audit records and X-Policy-* debug output.
#
# The `ibmverify` claim-mapper preset removes the reason for it: it wraps a JSON
# scalar into a one-element vec before the structured fields are read, so an
# unpadded single-valued attribute now maps correctly. The policy selects it with
#   claim_mapper: ibmverify
# on the jwt-user and jwt-agent plugins (policy-verify-opa.yaml.tmpl).
#
# So the values sent below are unpadded, and the CELx mappers in
# import-verify-clients.sh no longer append `+ ['']` either. Both sides have to
# agree: a tenant whose clients still carry the old padded mappers will mint
# ["engineer", ""] no matter what this script stores, because the mapper rebuilds
# the array from getCustomValues(). Re-run import-verify-clients.sh after this.
#
# If you are pointing this at a gateway WITHOUT the ibmverify preset, the padding
# is load-bearing again — see git history for the version that appends it.
#
# `manager` is NOT one of these attributes and never was padded — it is not a
# custom attribute at all. See the next section.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# `manager` is a SCIM relationship, not a custom attribute
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The other four claims are custom attributes in customAttribute1..150 slots.
# `manager` is different in kind: it is the standard SCIM EnterpriseUser
# extension's manager reference,
#
#   "urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:extension:enterprise:2.0:User": {
#     "manager": { "value": "<SCIM id>", "$ref": "<.../Users/<id>>" }
#   }
#
# and its value is the manager's SCIM **id**, not their userName. The tenant
# generates $ref itself; only `value` is written.
#
# This matters because of what the token mapper does with it. The introspection
# mapper on the client is:
#
#   statements:
#     - context: manager := user.getManager()
#     - return: context.manager.userName
#
# getManager() FOLLOWS the reference above and returns the manager's user object,
# and the mapper reads .userName off it. So the claim is a scalar string
# ("alice") produced by a relationship traversal — there is no custom attribute
# holding it, and creating one would be dead weight the mapper never reads.
# (The tenant's own `manager_uid` attribute is sourced from
# ...enterprise:2.0:User:manager.value, i.e. from this same relationship.)
#
# TWO CONSEQUENCES for this script:
#
#   1. It cannot be set in the CREATE payload, because the manager's id does not
#      exist until that user is created. bob names alice, and if alice is created
#      after bob there is nothing to reference. So managers are a SECOND PASS
#      (link_managers) after every user exists, resolving userName -> id.
#
#   2. It is a PATCH, not a field: op=replace on
#      <enterprise schema>:manager. Verified on a live tenant — 204, and the
#      read-back carries the generated $ref. op=remove clears it.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# pwdReset: a REQUEST HEADER, not a payload field
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Verify sets pwdReset=true on every user created through the SCIM API — the
# "user must change password at next sign-in" flag. It is how Verify treats any
# admin-set password. The user is otherwise perfect, but ROPC refuses it:
#
#   CSIAQ0267E The password must be changed.
#
# which names neither the user nor the cause, so it reads like a bad password in
# users.csv or a broken client.
#
# The fix is a request header on POST /v2.0/Users:
#
#   usershouldnotneedtoresetpassword: true
#
# Verified: with it the create returns pwdReset=null and the password grant
# works immediately; without it, pwdReset=true and every mint fails.
#
# It is worth being explicit about WHY this is a header, because the natural
# assumption is that it must be a payload field somewhere. It is not, and the
# payload cannot express it — all of these were tried against a live tenant:
#
#   - pwdReset:false in the create body   -> 201, silently ignored
#   - PATCH pwdReset                      -> 400 CSIAI0174E (read-only; a PATCH
#                                            of `active` returns 204, so the
#                                            request shape was not the problem)
#   - PATCH password to a NEW value       -> 204, pwdReset STAYS true — an admin
#                                            write is itself a reset
#   - userCategory:"federated"            -> 400, and changes what the user is
#
# So there is no way to discover this from the payload or from reading a working
# user back: an already-fixed user and a header-created one look identical.
#
# create_users() also still reports any user that comes back with pwdReset=true,
# which now means the header was rejected or ignored (a tenant that does not
# honour it) rather than the normal state of affairs.

# 1. Custom attribute definitions
# ==========================================================================
# A custom attribute must exist in the TENANT SCHEMA before a user payload may
# carry it — an undefined attribute fails the create with a validation error
# rather than being created implicitly. Each definition claims one of the
# predefined customAttribute1..150 slots.
#
# datatype string[] is what keeps these multi-valued. The slot numbers are
# arbitrary but must be stable: changing one after users exist orphans the
# stored values.
#
# Verify's scimName validator accepts LETTERS ONLY — an underscore or hyphen is
# rejected with "CSIAI0096E The value <x> is not valid for attribute [scimName]"
# (a 400 that is NOT an "already exists" 400). So the display name and the
# scimName have to be allowed to differ: gh_permissions -> ghpermissions.
#
# The scimName is the operative one — the CELx claim mappers call
# user.getCustomValues("<scimName>"), and import-verify-clients.sh resolves it
# from the tenant rather than assuming name == scimName. Keep this in sync with
# that script and with verify/README.md.
#
# `manager` is deliberately NOT in this list: it is a SCIM relationship, not a
# custom attribute, and the client's mapper reaches it with getManager() rather
# than getCustomValues(). Adding it here would claim a slot nothing reads. See
# the "manager is a SCIM relationship" section in the header and link_managers().

# existed, which is the common case when re-running against a live tenant where
