#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Render policy-verify-<variant>.yaml from policy-verify-<variant>.yaml.tmpl,
# for each of the three PDP variants on the IBM Verify path (opa, cel, cedar).
#
# The Verify path's tenant URL and exchange client_id are tenant-specific, and
# Verify GENERATES client ids — so a rebuilt tenant invalidates whatever is
# committed. Praxis has no env-var support for `client_id` (only the client
# SECRET has a `client_secret_source: {kind: env_var}` indirection; client_id is
# a plain String read straight into the outbound Basic auth header), so
# substitution has to happen before the gateway reads the file. This script is
# that step.
#
# The two substituted values are variant-independent, so they are resolved once
# and every selected variant gets the same tenant and client id.
#
# Usage:
#   ./render-verify-config.sh              # render all three, skipping up-to-date
#   ./render-verify-config.sh cel          # render only the CEL variant
#   ./render-verify-config.sh opa cedar    # render a subset
#   ./render-verify-config.sh --force      # re-render even if up to date
#   ./render-verify-config.sh --check      # verify only; non-zero if any stale
#   ./render-verify-config.sh --print cel  # render to stdout, write nothing
#
# --print needs exactly one variant: concatenating three policy documents onto
# one stream produces a file that is not a valid config for anything.
#
# restart.sh calls this automatically for any *verify* GATEWAY_CONFIG, passing
# the variant that matches it, so the normal path needs nothing.
#
# Requires: python3 (already required by verify/import-verify-*.sh).
# Deliberately NOT envsubst: that is gettext, absent from a stock macOS and from
# minimal Linux images, and it would substitute every $VAR in the file rather
# than the two intended ones.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# What is and is not substituted
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#   ${VERIFY_TENANT_URL}         default: IBM_VERIFY_TOKEN_ENDPOINT in
#                                post_deploy_variables.json, minus /oauth2/token
#   ${VERIFY_GATEWAY_CLIENT_ID}  default: GATEWAY_CLIENT_ID in that same file
#
# The client SECRET is deliberately absent. It stays a runtime lookup by the
# gateway (client_secret_source: {kind: env_var}), so a live credential never
# lands in a rendered file. Keep it that way: this output is a plain file in the
# working tree, and the gitignore entry is the only thing between it and a commit.
#
# The Keycloak CIBA endpoints in the template are literal localhost URLs and are
# NOT templated — that plugin still points at Keycloak (see the note in the
# template), so templating them would imply a portability that does not exist.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Two kinds of ${...}, and why the distinction is load-bearing
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The Cedar template writes `id: ${args.repo_name}` — a PRAXIS interpolation,
# resolved per-request by the gateway from the live tool args. It must survive
# into the rendered file untouched.
#
# So the two namespaces are split by case, which is why the convention is worth
# keeping:
#
#   ${UPPER_SNAKE}   this script's placeholders. Unknown ones abort the render,
#                    and any left unsubstituted abort it too.
#   ${anything.else} Praxis's own, passed through verbatim.
#
# The strictness on the first is the point: an unresolved ${VERIFY_...} would
# reach the gateway as a literal string, pass the non-empty client_id check, and
# fail much later at the token endpoint as invalid_client — a long way from the
# typo that caused it.
