# Bob (HR, group=hr) tries to search github repos. APL's coarse
# gate fails immediately — Bob isn't in engineering or security.
# The deny happens BEFORE the PDP runs, before any IdP call.
#
# This shows the "fast path" in the policy: cheap predicates run
# first, expensive PDP / IdP work only happens for requests that
# clear them.
#
#   Layer 1 — APL gate `require(team.engineering | team.security)`
#             → FAILS (Bob is in team.hr)
#   Layers 2-4 — never reached. PDP never invoked, IdP never
#             called, no token-exchange round-trip.
#
# Result: HTTP 200 + JSON-RPC error code -32001, data.violation =
# the apl.policy step index that failed.
