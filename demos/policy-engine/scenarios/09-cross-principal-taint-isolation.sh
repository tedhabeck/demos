# Cross-principal taint isolation. Session taint is keyed by the
# resolved subject, not the raw X-Session-Id: the engine's session store
# binds it as H(subject : session_id). So the *same* session id under
# two different users resolves to two different buckets — one user's
# taint can't bleed into another's.
#
#   S1 bob  send_email     (sid=baseline)  → 200 OK   (clean baseline)
#   S2 eve  get_compensation (sid=shared)  → 200 OK   (taints H(eve:shared))
#   S3 bob  send_email     (sid=shared)    → 200 OK   (H(bob:shared) is a
#      different bucket; bob never accessed secrets, so no taint inherited)
#
# Pre-isolation (a raw, un-subject-scoped session key) S3 would have
# been denied with session_tainted_secret. The 200 proves the scoping.
