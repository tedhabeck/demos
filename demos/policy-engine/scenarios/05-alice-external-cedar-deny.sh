# Alice (engineering) asks for an EXTERNAL repo. APL's coarse gate
# passes (she IS in engineering), but the PDP policy doesn't permit
# engineering on external visibility — only security can read those.
# The denial happens at the gateway BEFORE any IdP call.
#
#   Layer 1 — APL gate → passes (team.engineering)
#   Layer 2 — PDP → DENIES (engineering rule fails:
#             visibility == "external", not "internal";
#             violation: cedar.default_deny / cel.policy_denied / opa.policy_denied)
#   Layers 3-4 — never reached. No token exchange. GitHub never sees
#             the request.
#
# Result: HTTP 200 + JSON-RPC error code -32001 — per MCP's Tools
# spec, gateway denials are reported as JSON-RPC errors inside HTTP
# 200, not as HTTP 4xx. The data.violation depends on the PDP backend:
# "cedar.default_deny" under policy-cedar.yaml (Cedar); "cel.policy_denied"
# under policy-cel.yaml (CEL); "opa.policy_denied" under policy-opa.yaml
# (Rego).
