# Human-in-the-loop threshold — the pass-through half.
# adjust_compensation is a sensitive mutating action. The route applies
# require_approval ONLY when args.amount > $10,000; a smaller change goes
# straight through with no manager sign-off. This scenario exercises that
# under-threshold path — fully non-interactive, like scenarios 01-09.

#   Bob (HR) → adjust_compensation(EMP-001234, +$5,000)
#     → 200 OK, status "applied"  (require(role.hr) ✓, under $10k → no approval)
#
# The over-threshold path (approval required) is scenario 11.
# All three PDP configs behave identically here — the route
# has no PDP step.
