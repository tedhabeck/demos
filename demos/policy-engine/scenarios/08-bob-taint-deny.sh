# Session tainting — cross-tool, cross-request data-flow control.
# get_compensation runs `taint(secret, session)`; a later send_email in
# the SAME session is denied even with a CLEAN body, because the
# *session* (not the content) is tainted. This is what distinguishes it
# from scenario 07's content-based PII deny.
#
# Three beats, with fresh per-run session ids so reruns start clean
# (taint labels persist in the Valkey session store, keyed by
# H(subject:session_id), so a fixed id would carry over between runs):
#   S1 send_email (clean session)      → 200 OK
#   S2 get_compensation (taints sess)  → 200 OK  (+ taint(secret, session))
#   S3 send_email (SAME session as S2) → HTTP 200 + JSON-RPC error -32001,
#      violation = session_tainted_secret   (clean body, tainted session)
#
# The session id is threaded via the X-Session-Id header (see _lib.sh);
# the policy filter maps it to agent.session_id and the engine's
# session store binds it to the resolved subject.
