# Human-in-the-loop manager approval — the over-threshold half.
# Bob asks for a >$10k adjustment; the gateway SUSPENDS the call with
# JSON-RPC -32120 (NOT a deny) and requests Bob's manager (Alice) to
# approve out-of-band over OIDC CIBA. The four beats:
#
#   S1 adjust_compensation (+$25k) → -32120 pending; capture the
#      elicitation_id + approver from error.data
#   S2 the manager approves:
#        default        — you open http://localhost:5001 and click Approve
#        AUTO_APPROVE=1  — the script drives the auth-channel /pending +
#                          /approve endpoints (no human click)
#   S3 peek (X-Policy-Elicitation-Id + peek) until the gateway answers
#      -32121 (approved) — reports status, does NOT apply. Polls slower
#      than Keycloak's CIBA interval (~5s) to avoid a slow_down.
#   S4 re-send WITHOUT peek → 200 OK, status "applied" — the raise lands.
#
# The approval is bound to the amount (scope: args.amount <= 25000), so a
# sign-off can't be replayed against a larger change.
#
# Needs the FULL stack (more than scenarios 01-10): restart.sh brings up
# Keycloak with CIBA + the channel SPI, the auth-channel approval UI on
# :5001, valkey, and the gateway.
# All three PDP configs behave identically (no PDP step here).
