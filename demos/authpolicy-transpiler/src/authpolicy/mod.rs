//! This is the Phase A (mapping-feasibility) surface of the `AuthPolicy`
//! support spike: it parses the supported subset of `AuthPolicy`
//! (`kuadrant.io/v1`, targeting Authorino `v1beta3`) and translates it
//! best-effort, emitting a structured coverage report. No proxy runtime

// The model is a faithful representation of the AuthPolicy schema; not
// every parsed field is consumed by the translator (e.g. tracing-only or
// reported-as-gap fields), and the module is wired into a subcommand in a
// later unit. Allow dead code across the transpiler module during the spike.

// Deserialize methods have large (but cold) stack frames. This is expected
// for faithful config types and not a hot path.
#![allow(clippy::large_stack_frames, reason = "faithful nested config model")]
// The translator's mapping functions are long but linear (one arm per

// scatter cohesive logic. The CEL remapper slices strings at byte offsets
// returned by `find()` on ASCII needles, which are always char boundaries.
