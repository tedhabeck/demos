# AuthPolicy transpiler

A standalone CLI that converts a Kuadrant [`AuthPolicy`](https://docs.kuadrant.io/latest/kuadrant-operator/doc/overviews/auth/) into Praxis policy configuration: a `policy`-filter block plus a policy document. It is best-effort and prints a coverage report saying exactly what was translated, approximated, or skipped.

Use it to see how an existing Kuadrant `AuthPolicy` would look under Praxis + the Praxis Policy Engine, without hand-rewriting anything.

## What it shows

- Kuadrant `AuthPolicy` (`kuadrant.io/v1`, Authorino `v1beta3`) parsed and mapped to the engine's canonical policy form.
- JWT authentication becomes an engine `identity/jwt` plugin; CEL authorization (`patternMatching` predicates, `when`, `patterns`, and the deprecated `selector`/`operator`/`value` form) becomes `cel: { expr }` PDP steps under the `global` policy's `authorization.pre_invocation` block, gated by a native `require(authenticated)` presence check.
- A coverage report that classifies every construct, so gaps are visible rather than silently dropped.
- Fail-closed behaviour: if a policy declares authorization but nothing translates, the output is a `require(false)` deny-all and the CLI exits non-zero.

The following demo shows transpiles the sample policies and reads the coverage report:

## Quick start

```console
# Print the policy doc + Praxis filter block + coverage report to stdout
cargo run -- examples/jwt-rbac.yaml

# Or write the three artifacts to a directory
cargo run -- examples/jwt-rbac.yaml --out-dir ./out
```

The emitted policy uses the canonical block form. A `when` over the request line becomes an `http:` route selector, so each rule carries only its own condition:

```yaml
plugins:
  - name: keycloak-jwt
    kind: identity/jwt
    capabilities: [perform_http]          # the engine performs no outbound HTTP itself
    hooks: [identity.resolve]
    on_error: fail
    config: { ... }
routes:
  - http: { path_prefix: /api, method: [GET] }
    authorization:
      pre_invocation:
        - cel: { expr: "<remapped CEL>" }
  - http: { path_prefix: / }              # catch-all, governed by `global:` below
global:
  authentication:
    - keycloak-jwt
  authorization:
    pre_invocation:
      - "require(authenticated)"          # native presence gate, stacked into every route
  pdp:
    - kind: cel
```

`spec.when` becomes `path_prefix` when it is exactly `request.path.startsWith('<absolute>')`, and a rule's own `when` becomes `method` when it is exactly `request.method == '<M>'` or a `||` chain of those. Recognition is all-or-nothing: a predicate the selector cannot express in full stays CEL, gating its rule as `!(when) || (rule)` the way it always did. So a negated or compound activation (`!request.path.startsWith('/public')`) emits no route and nothing is lost.

Rules sharing a selector are merged into one route. Two routes with identical coordinates would make the engine keep the second and warn, which would drop a rule.

Everything left is a `cel: { expr }` PDP step, dispatched to the engine's bundled `cel` resolver, which evaluates full CEL (`startsWith`, `&&`/`||`, literal `in`). The APL-native `require(...)` form is used only for the `require(authenticated)` presence gate and the `require(false)` fail-closed sentinel, because `require(...)` parses APL's own predicate DSL, not CEL. `require(authenticated)` and `pdp:` sit on `global:`: the engine stacks the global layer into every route, and `pdp:` is a `global:` key and nowhere else.

The coverage report summarises the mapping:

```text
AuthPolicy → Praxis coverage report
===================================
translated: 4   approximated: 4   skipped: 1

[INFO ] translated    authentication/keycloak-jwt
          JWT → identity/jwt ...
[WARN ] approximated  authentication (claims)
          a rule references a nested identity claim (Keycloak realm_access.roles) ...
[WARN ] skipped       authorization/via-opa
          authorization method `opa` is not supported ...
```

Per input policy, `--out-dir` writes `<name>-policy-doc.yaml`, `<name>-policy-filter.yaml`, and `<name>-coverage.txt`. Multiple input files and multi-document (`---`) YAML are supported. The process exits non-zero if any policy fails closed.

Try the other samples to see the range: `examples/apikey-opa.yaml` (unsupported methods, fails closed) and `examples/gateway-defaults.yaml` (`defaults` block, metadata/callbacks reported as gaps).

## End-to-end on Praxis + the Policy Engine

`examples/jwt-cel-http.yaml` is the "happy path": it translates cleanly (no approximations) and its output runs, unedited, as a generic-HTTP (L7) authorization policy on Praxis with the Praxis Policy Engine. The `e2e/` directory is a **self-contained** runner — it brings up its own Keycloak, transpiles the example, builds Praxis, and proves the CEL decisions with real persona tokens:

```console
cd e2e
./run-demo.sh
```

The run transpiles the AuthPolicy, deploys the emitted policy on Praxis, and proves the CEL decisions with alice/bob tokens — showing both the original AuthPolicy and the deployed policy along the way:

[![AuthPolicy transpiler end-to-end demo](https://asciinema.org/a/BeWTbAEyGrzEQvAN.svg)](https://asciinema.org/a/BeWTbAEyGrzEQvAN)

That single command:

1. Starts **Keycloak** (`e2e/docker-compose.yml`, realm `e2e/keycloak/realm-export.json`) and waits for OIDC discovery.
2. Transpiles `examples/jwt-cel-http.yaml` into `e2e/out/` (policy doc + Praxis filter block).
3. Injects a localhost-dev `insecure_http` shim into the emitted JWKS `decoding_key` (never needed with an https IdP).
4. Builds **Praxis** with `--features policy-engine` (`e2e/build-praxis.sh`) — from the sibling `../../../../praxis` checkout if there is one, otherwise a clone at the **pinned commit** in `DEFAULT_GIT_REF`, so a run is reproducible rather than tracking a moving branch. Override with `PRAXIS_BIN` / `PRAXIS_DIR` / `PRAXIS_GIT_URL` / `PRAXIS_GIT_REF` (`PRAXIS_GIT_REF=main` tracks the branch).
5. Starts a tiny echo backend (`:9200`) and the gateway (`:8095`, `e2e/praxis.yaml`: `policy` → `router` → `load_balancer`).
6. Mints `alice`/`bob` tokens (`e2e/mint-token.sh`) and exercises the CEL policy.

The AuthPolicy expresses two rules over the HTTP request line and top-level identity claims. The request-line half becomes route selectors and the identity half stays CEL, where Kuadrant array-membership maps to the engine's boolean identity namespaces (`role.*` / `perm.*`) that the `standard` claim mapper populates:

- **reads** — `http: { path_prefix: /api, method: [GET] }` requires the `tool_execute` permission: `'tool_execute' in auth.identity.permissions` → `has(perm.tool_execute) && perm.tool_execute`
- **writes** — `http: { path_prefix: /api, method: [POST, DELETE] }` requires the `hr` role: `'hr' in auth.identity.roles` → `has(role.hr) && role.hr`

Both are the same decisions the folded form made; what moved is where the request shape is matched. The router picks the route, so the PDP evaluates one identity predicate instead of an implication over the path and method tests.

| Request | Persona | Result | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| `GET /api/...`  | alice (engineer) | **200** | has `tool_execute` |
| `GET /api/...`  | bob (hr)         | **200** | has `tool_execute` |
| `POST /api/...` | alice (engineer) | **403** | CEL deny — not `hr` |
| `POST /api/...` | bob (hr)         | **200** | CEL allow — `hr` |
| `GET /api/...`  | (no token)       | **401** | identity gate |

Requirements: `docker` (compose), `cargo`, `python3`, `curl`, `jq`. Keycloak binds host port `8081` and imports the `policy-demo` realm — the same as the sibling `policy-engine` demo, so run only one at a time. First run is slow (Praxis release build); later runs reuse the cached binary.

## Scope and limitations

The transpiler covers the subset that maps cleanly to CEL. Everything else is reported, not dropped.

- **Authentication:** JWT only (JWKS, issuer, audiences). `apiKey`, `x509`/mTLS, `anonymous`, `oauth2Introspection`, and `kubernetesTokenReview` are reported as gaps. Multi-rule priority/fallback is reported, not preserved.
- **Authorization:** CEL only. `opa` (Rego), `spicedb`, and `kubernetesSubjectAccessReview` are reported as gaps.
- **Policy composition:** a single policy's rules. The `defaults`/`overrides` hierarchy and Gateway-to-route merge strategies (GEP-2649) are collapsed to a single flat policy and reported.
- **Response:** custom `denyWith` (status/body/headers) is **not** yet carried into the emitted policy — it is reported as `approximated`, and a denial uses the engine's default (401 identity / 403 authorization). Success-response injection is best-effort and reported.
- **Metadata and callbacks:** reported as gaps.
- **Binding and lifecycle (out of scope):** no Gateway API translation (`targetRef` to listeners/routes), no CRD ingestion or operator, no reverse translation, no multi-version schema support.
- **Signing algorithms:** not expressible in a Kuadrant JWT block, so the emitted trusted issuer defaults to `RS256` (the OIDC default). Widen it in the emitted policy if the IdP signs with ES256/etc.
- **CEL namespaces:** predicates are lexically remapped from Kuadrant's vocabulary to the engine's. The HTTP request line maps directly (`request.*` → `http.*`). Identity RBAC uses the membership idiom: `'<v>' in auth.identity.roles` / `.permissions` / `.groups`|`.teams` → the engine's boolean namespaces `has(role.<v>) && role.<v>` / `perm.<v>` / `team.<v>`, which is what the `standard` claim mapper populates. Other identity references fall back to `auth.identity.* → claim.*` and are a runtime gap wherever `claim.*` is unpopulated (e.g. nested `realm_access.roles`, scalar claims). A reference that does not remap at all (e.g. `auth.metadata.*`) is reported as a gap and dropped rather than emitted as wrong-namespace CEL.

The emitted documents are checked by the golden corpus under `tests/` and the structural invariant assertions in `src/main.rs`. This demo depends only on `serde`, `serde_yaml`, and `clap`; it does not parse its output through the engine's crate.
