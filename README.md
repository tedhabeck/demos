# Praxis demos

Runnable, self-contained demos and setups for [Praxis](https://github.com/praxis-proxy/praxis).
Each demo lives under `demos/<name>/` with its own README.

## Demos

| Demo | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [anthropic-messages](demos/anthropic-messages/) | Route Anthropic `/v1/messages` requests to any backend — Anthropic API, vLLM, or OpenAI-compatible — with optional format transformation via composable filters. |
| [authpolicy-transpiler](demos/authpolicy-transpiler/) | Offline CLI that transpiles a Kuadrant `AuthPolicy` into Praxis policy config (a `policy`-filter block plus a Praxis Policy Engine policy document), with a coverage report showing what maps to CEL and what is out of scope. |
| [policy-engine](demos/policy-engine/) | Policy enforcement on MCP traffic: authorization flows connecting identity to access control decisions with Cedar or CEL PDP, delegation, out-of-band elicitation, data redaction, and session tainting. |
| [openai-responses-stateless](demos/openai-responses-stateless/) | Stateless passthrough for OpenAI `/v1/responses` with `store: false`. Praxis classifies the request, detects stateless mode, and proxies directly to vLLM — no buffering, no persistence, no transformation. |
| [openai-responses-codex-passthrough](demos/openai-responses-codex-passthrough/) | Live Codex CLI passthrough to the OpenAI Responses API. Demonstrates model alias rewriting, default injection, effective-model headers, SSE, and a Codex-owned tool loop. Run the [all-in-one narrated demo](demos/openai-responses-codex-passthrough/README.md#all-in-one-recommended) or each [step individually](demos/openai-responses-codex-passthrough/README.md#step-by-step-multi-terminal). |
| [openai-responses-multi-turn](demos/openai-responses-multi-turn/) | Multi-turn conversation (non-streaming) for the OpenAI Responses API. Praxis stores turn 1 in SQLite, then rehydrates the conversation history on turn 2 via `previous_response_id` and rebuilds the request body before forwarding to vLLM. |
| [openai-responses-streaming-multi-turn](demos/openai-responses-streaming-multi-turn/) | Streaming multi-turn with `previous_response_id`. Turn 1 non-streaming stored in SQLite, turn 2 streaming with rehydrated history — SSE events accumulated by `openai_stream_events` and persisted at end-of-stream. |
| [openai-conversations](demos/openai-conversations/) | Full CRUD lifecycle for the OpenAI `/v1/conversations` API handled entirely locally by Praxis — create, retrieve, update, delete conversations and items, all backed by SQLite with no upstream traffic. |
| [openai-conversations-multi-turn](demos/openai-conversations-multi-turn/) | Multi-turn via `conversation` field — create a conversation, reference it by ID on each turn. Praxis rehydrates stored items, forwards full context to vLLM, and auto-appends input+output back to the conversation. |
| [openai-responses-file-resolve](demos/openai-responses-file-resolve/) | File resolution + document extraction — send a `file_id` in a Responses API request, Praxis resolves it via OGX, extracts text content, and converts `input_file` → `input_text` for vLLM. |
| [openai-responses-agentic-loop](demos/openai-responses-agentic-loop/) | Server-side agentic loop — model calls an MCP tool, Praxis dispatches to the MCP server and loops the result back to the model for a final answer. No client-side orchestration needed. |
| [openai-responses-file-search](demos/openai-responses-file-search/) | Server-side file search — model calls file_search, Praxis dispatches to OGX's vector store search API, loops back with ranked results, and the model answers grounded in retrieved documents. |
| [skillberry-agent-proxy](demos/skillberry-agent-proxy/) | A fully automated demo of Praxis as an agentic gateway for the Skillberry Agent platform, based on [skillberry-agent-praxis-poc](https://github.com/skillberry-ai/skillberry-agent-praxis-poc) |

## Grid QuickStarts

Multi-cluster Grid demos that prove distributed inference routing with
runtime assertions. Each demo requires a local
[praxis-proxy/grid](https://github.com/praxis-proxy/grid) checkout
(or set `GRID_REPO`), Docker, kind, and Rust.

| Demo | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [grid-glb-demo](demos/grid-glb-demo/) | Local GTM emulator, multiple active edges, independent provider selection |
| [grid-workload-inference](demos/grid-workload-inference/) | Cluster-local workload entry without public ingress |
| [grid-llmd-pool-metrics](demos/grid-llmd-pool-metrics/) | EPP telemetry, Grid scoring, A-to-B-to-A capacity failover |
| [grid-combined-site](demos/grid-combined-site/) | Consumer and secured provider roles colocated at each site |

## Grid Labs and Guides

Script-driven Grid demos and reference guides for specific topics.

| Demo | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [grid-route53-edge-entry](demos/grid-route53-edge-entry/) | Route 53 DNS edge selection with Grid provider routing on existing OpenShift clusters |
| [grid-metrics-mtls](demos/grid-metrics-mtls/) | Secret-backed TLS and mTLS for InferenceProvider metrics scraping |

## MaaS Labs

| Demo | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [maas-ipp](demos/maas-ipp/) | Single-cluster MaaS IPP lab reproducing the stock MaaS Kind datapath with Forge |

## Media and Large Files

Do not commit videos or other large binary media to this repository. They bloat
the git history for everyone who clones or fetches, and git cannot compress
already-compressed formats like MP4.

Instead, upload media as GitHub artifacts (e.g. drag files into markdown editor
on the web, or use a release asset, or a workflow artifact) and link them from
the relevant documentation.
